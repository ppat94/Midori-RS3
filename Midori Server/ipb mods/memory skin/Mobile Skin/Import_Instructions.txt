Installation Instructions for Memory Mobile Skin:
----------------------------------------------------


1. Import the two XML files just like any other skin in your Look and Feel
tab of the ACP. These files are:

memory-mobile.xml.gz
images-memorymobile.xml.gz



Setting Your New Mobile Skin as Default Mobile Skin
---------------------------------------------------


1. After importing, go to the dropdown link next to the DEFAULT IP.Board Mobile skin
in your Look and Feel tab, and click "Edit Settings."


2. Change the "Skin Set Key?" option to "mobile_12345" and NOTHING else after it. You
can change it to whatever you like, just make sure it no longer says "mobile."
This is because the default mobile skin will only be chosen if the skin set key is just
plain "mobile." Save.
NOTE: IPS has hidden the skin set key in many cases, so if you don't see it, there is
an easy, but not obvious way to do it. If you need help, email bitter@finalprestige.net
and we'll take care of it for you.


3. Next, uncheck the option that displays the default skin as default for everyone.


4. Now go to "Edit Settings" of Memory Mobile, and change the skin set key to "mobile" (with no numbers after it)
and save.
NOTE: Again, if you don't see the skin set key appear, same message as in step 2.


5. Lastly, check the option to make Memory Mobile the default skin for everyone.
