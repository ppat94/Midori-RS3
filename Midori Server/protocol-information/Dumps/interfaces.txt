I can't believe I'm going to starve down here.<br><br>If you've found this, I hope you have better luck than me. I was carrying tools for the Death Guard when shadows attacked us. The team outside died while I got pulled in to the Temple and was teleported to this...place.<br><br>I've just about given up trying to understand the trees here. They reflect light, and I could rotate them when I first came here, but I just don't have the strength any more .<br><br>I hope this helps you: the cores not only reflect, but can be charged. If light enters from behind, it passes through and mixes lights together. As for the receivers, perhaps they have something to do with the colour wheel?

Five hundred years have passed since the rule of King Alvis,






saviour of Keldagrim, victim of his own inventions.

that were to serve the monarchy, eventually the monarchy came






to serve the Consortium.






By the time of his death, the monarchy was all but abolished.

Now that I have found a new home, it is time for me to start my research. It will probably take me years, decades, maybe even centuries... <br><br>The toll it will take does not matter. I will make a device that will bring Glouphrie to his knees.

A History of the Goblin Race













Goblin tradition holds that<br>their race was created by<br>a war-god in order to<br>fight a war against other<br>gods.






(They never name their<br>god, so whether it is the<br>same as any of the gods<br>worshipped by the other<br>races is unknown.)






The legends also speak<br>of goblins fighting<br>against goblins during<br>the wars, so it is likely<br>that gods other than<br>their creators used<br>them as footsoldiers.






Although goblins are still<br>warlike, it is probable<br>that in earlier ages<br>they were more<br>organised than they<br>are now,













especially if they were<br>under the direct<br>command of one or<br>more gods.






This is corroborated<br>by finds unearthed<br>at various<br>archaeological sites,<br>including the large<br>excavation east of<br>Varrock.






Armour and weapons<br>have been found,<br>obviously made to fit<br>goblins but far more<br>well-made than their<br>current equipment.













Almost every piece of<br>ancient goblin equipment<br>has one of a number<br>of symbols on it,<br>and by correlating these<br>symbols with the<br>sketchy records that<br>survive from the<br>Third Age it has been<br>possible to identify<br>twelve distinct goblin tribes<br>or regiments.






The separate identities of<br>the tribes have long<br>since dissolved and<br>no goblins remember the<br>symbols, although their<br>generals may still<br>recognize the ancient<br>tribal names.






In the following pages<br>I present a list of<br>the tribes and their<br>symbols.

INTERFACE: 241





































An excerpt taken from the memoirs of Thaerisk Cemphier of the Crux Eqal: <br><br>?In my time working with the Guardians of Guthix I have been lucky enough to share many conversations with Death. I have learned much of the afterlife that I believe no mortal will have ever learned before, this is my understanding. Death (also known as The Grim Reaper) was tasked with the reaping of souls. This seems to quite literally mean severing the link between






the soul and the body, its tether to the physical world. He then brings the souls he has harvested deep beneath the surface of Gielinor, to the only crossing of an endless river which separates the realms of the living and the dead; the River Noumenon. It is a cold, dark place where a thick veil of fog hangs in the air. This is where Death says he leaves the souls to cross the long, stone bridge over the River Noumenon into the Realm of the Dead.






But that is not where their journey ends. As far as I can tell the Realm of the Dead is separated into three regions. On the far bank of the river are the gates of the Underworld, past the gates is the Underworld itself and beyond the Underworld is the afterlife (which many would describe as ?heaven?). The gates of the Underworld are where Icthlarin stands guard. He is more concerned with looking after the dead; the Underworld is a terrifying place filled with all






manner of horrible creatures. Icthlarin shepherds the souls through a gauntlet of devourer beasts of his sister - Amascut's - creation, which roam the Underworld in packs relentlessly searching for souls to consume. According to Death, Icthlarin protects them until they reach the afterlife and can be released; guiding them through the darkness with his blazing, green torch. He then dutifully returns to his post. Death tells me that inevitably some souls are devoured and lost forever. 






Perhaps unfairly, Icthlarin takes responsibility for this and bears the weight on his shoulders. I believe Death rarely goes to the Realm of the Dead, as he showed particular disinterest in describing it.<br><br>Thousands of years ago - before she became The Devourer - Amascut would stand opposite Icthlarin beside the gates of the Underworld, both atop separate pulpits.  Amascut would offer the the most worthy a choice to be reincarnated or continue to the






afterlife. Death claims she would ascend to the surface world with those who accepted and return them to life. As her mind has become warped she is no longer the God of Rebirth, instead hell bent on devouring any souls she can before they reach the afterlife. Now the pulpits stand in ruin over the banks of the River Noumenon.<br><br>It has also come to my attention that this is only the Underworld for Gielinor; there are separate ones for each world. Most






people considering Gielinor as their home will pass on to this Underworld, but some with different home worlds may go on to their own. This explains the different races beliefs of the afterlife, as many will return to the Underworld of their home.<br><br>Although he is unwilling to shed much light on the subject, I believe that Death is sometimes unable to completely sever a soul?s tie to the physical world. It seems this is due to an overpowering will to stay or






?unfinished business?. This is why there are ghosts in the surface world; they still remain attached to the realm of the living. In some cases a person's fate may hold great importance to the future of Gielinor; Death has been tasked to return these chosen few to life.<br><br>For some reason Death was reluctant to discuss what happens when a god dies. He did, however, detail that a god gives up the right to an afterlife when they ascend.






Instead their energy is transferred back into the world upon death.

Crime Scene: Monks






Core Clues






Crystals: One of the monks was impaled with multiple crystals.






Ring: I found a ring underneath a plant at the crimescene; someone must have dropped it here.






Arrow: There's an arrow lodged firmly in one of the trees. It has been expertly crafted with a sharp, crystal tip.






I now  have enough clues to return to Brother Samwell.













Crime Scene: Monks






Additional Clues






Attacker: I was able to listen to the monks' souls. One mentioned the attacker had a masked face.






Questioning






I found a witness known as the odd old man. He saw a tall, hooded figure escaping to the east.













Crime Scene: Elf






Core Clues






Necklace: I found a necklace with a symbol on the pendant; someone must have dropped it.






Ripped cloth: There was a piece of blue cloth caught on the fence. It looks like it was torn from a plain, linen robe.






Branded: Saradomin's symbol had been branded into the palms of the elf's hands.






I have enough clues to go to Brother Samwell.




















Crime Scene: Elf






Additional Clues






Attacker: The elf's soul also mentioned a 'figure', 'shadows' and 'came out of nowhere'.






Note: It referred to some orders and was signed with a large 'S'.






Questioning






I spoke to Blaze Sharpeye. He said the killer vanished by creating a rift that seemed to absorb light from the area.













Wizard Valina






Information






The crystal clues don't seem to match Valina's research of the elves. Also, the crystals are extremely precious, so it would be strange for an elf to leave them behind.






The stab wound and torn cloth suggest the killer wasn't a wizard.






Teleports emit light instead of absorbing it. It's more likely that the killer opened a rift to another realm or dimension.

Use this ring when you are ready to summon me to your aid. It is a daunting task, yet you must battle the king to allow me to remove the spell from him. When the king is almost dead, use this ring and I will teleport to your aid. Be warned - Though I am skilled with magic, I am no fighter!

Clockwork Toys - A Clockwork Mechanism, Chapter 1.0













Making a clockwork toy is very simple and a good place to start for new crafters. Simply create a clockwork mechanism on your Crafting table, then use it and a wood plank to make a toy soldier or a doll. Wind them up and watch them go!






Multi-rotation head for lifelike simulation






A well-hidden clockwork system













The clockwork mechanism.













It would be simple to alter the design by adding a piece of silk to the wooden frame and clockwork mechanism. You could make a suit that could be controlled from the inside.

Book Title



INTERFACE: 554







































































































































  - On the Infernal Legions - <br><br>  Woe to the world; it languishes beneath the demon's cloven hoof!  It is known without doubt that the demonic legions amass and grow stronger.  They may appear without warning, in places of sorrow and rot, or any wild and remote location.<br><br>  There the world bears witness to the arrival of those most dangerous of the fellborn: the demonic generals.


































  Many are the forms and names of these fiends, these lords of the pit.  They come arrayed for war, with gleaming tusk and iron claw.  Nothing may stand against their fury.  Nothing is left in their wake but ruination.<br><br>  As a fire hungers for fuel, so too do they hunger for blood and suffering.  Every blow they land heals them of even the most grievous wounds.  Beware, lest by facing your foe you pave the way to your doom!


































  But in this, take heart: breaching the veil of this world causes them terrible wounds.  Before it may unleash its fury upon the world it must first shed the blood of its closest followers.<br><br>  Each general is accompanied by many companions.  The general will slay each footman in turn and the blood of this sacrifice will fuel its rebirth.


































Once they lie dead, the general will turn upon his lieutenants and in betrayal drain them of energy to become mighty indeed.<br><br>Slay first the general's heralds.  With them dispatched, he will direct his footmen to destroy you.<br><br>  Slay next the footmen, for without them the general will be sorely weakened.
















































Slay next the lieutenants, without whom the general will have no alternative but to fight.<br><br>  May Saradomin watch over you from this moment onwards, for very little else will bring you victory.<br><br>- On the Unholy Praetorians -<br><br>While the titles and duties of the demonic leaders vary wildly, they do display some traits in common.


































- Generals are war leaders without peer, whose attacks rarely miss.<br>- Executioners are bloodthirsty and strong beyond measure.<br>- Castellans guard the unholy monuments and are skilled in physical defence.<br>- Deacons lead the demons in profane rituals and are skilled magic users.<br><br>Plan your assault around these traits wisely.  But beware, for the demons also possess powers that set them aside from their peers.


































  The glorious stun their targets.  The blazing set their victims aflame.  The rending leave their enemies bleeding.  The pestilent poison and defile.<br><br>  The shattering hammer multiple targets at once.  The infernals set multiple targets on fire. The frostborn leave multiple foes encased in ice. The corrupting spread poison to all they encounter.<br><br>  The obscured make it difficult to attack. The terrifying make it harder to generate adrenaline.

Ignore?





































































There's no need to report anyone for using the term 'noob', it simply means 'new player'.<br><br>Seriously offensive language includes racism and chat of a sexual nature.<br><br>You don't need to report players for using abbreviations such as 'lmao', 'wtf', 'gtfo'.<br><br>You shouldn't report any chat that has been starred out (like this: ****), as the censor has prevented anything that may have been offensive from being seen.<br><br>Solicitation includes asking for a boyfriend or girlfriend in-game.<br><br>Disruptive behaviour includes flooding the chat window with lines of unnecessary chat, but only if you feel it's impairing your gameplay.<br><br>Beware of context when reporting players for real-life threats: they could be talking about in-game combat!


































Now that your report has been sent, you can choose whether or not to ignore the offender. This is a temporary measure, and will only last until you log out. To permanently ignore a player, make a note of their name and add them to your Ignore List once the 'Report' windows are closed.<br><br>You cannot ignore moderators or people on your Friends List.



























Giving out your contact information in-game can put the security of your account at risk. There are some unscrupulous people out there, so, to protect your account and your privacy, it makes sense not to give your details to anyone you don't know.<br><br>Contact information includes: full name, email addresses, instant messenger screen names, telephone numbers, your home/work address or age.<br><br>Promoting a non-Jagex website in the forums or in-game could get you banned, even if you post the URL for your clan's site. We understand this rule may cause some inconvenience, but we want it to be impossible for people to send players to scam sites.


































An item scam is defined as cheating another player during a trade. We don't consider it a scam to ask for large amounts of gp for an item, but it is not in the spirit of the game to overprice an item. It is your responsibility to make sure that you are paying a good price.<br><br>Asking for someone's bank PIN or recovery answers is just as serious as asking for a password; giving out your bank PIN allows other players access to your bank space. Never tell another player your password, PIN number or any other account security details.<br><br>If you notice a bug, please report it to us straight away. If, after noticing a bug, you continue to exploit it, you are likely to have action taken against your account.<br><br>There are no cheats for any of our games. Anyone that approaches you in-game to offer you cheats should be reported under 'Encouraging rule-breaking'.<br><br>Don't encourage rule-breaking, such as encouraging someone to try real-world trading, scamming or exploiting bugs.<br><br>You should not swap your account with another player, or share your account with anyone else. Sharing your account makes it less secure, and is also unfair to other players.









































Here you can select the offence that you believe the player has committed.<br><br>Clicking one of the offence buttons will send recent chat to Player Support for investigation. You should act quickly to report the player, particularly in areas where there is a lot of chat, such as at the Grand Exchange.<br><br>If you have selected the wrong player, you can use the 'Change player' button to return to the chat list and choose again.<br><br>You can only report players who have spoken recently.<br><br>Once your report has been sent, you'll be asked if you want to temporarily add the offender to your Ignore List.

Watch out for rabbits wandering around the farmyard. They are hungry and will look for flags, as they often mean hidden food! If a rabbit eats the seed under a flag, you will not get any points for it and will lose the flag. 




















You can improve your Hunter skill by finding ogleroots in the farmyard and feeding them to the rabbits. Ogleroots are magical vegetables and will cause the rabbit to disappear for a short amount of time.
























INTERFACE: 685



    
































































































Farmer Blinkin's Vinesweeper Instructions






1. Speak to either Mrs. Winkin in the barn or Farmer Blinkin outside to buy some flags.






2. When you have some flags, head out into the farmyard area over any of the 4 stiles.






3. Use your spade to dig up any of the holes around the farmyard. This will uncover what was in that hole. The aim is to place your flags in holes where you believe seeds are planted.






4. If the hole has nothing in it, then it will uncover a radius of 2 holes in all directions






5. If you uncover a number from 1-8, this means that there are that many seeds planted in the 8 holes surrounding the one that you have dug up.






6. When you have a square that you are certain contains a seed, either right-click and select the 'Flag' option or use a flag on the hole.






7. When a farmer sees a flag, he will come over to check beneath it. He will collect the flag and give points out if there was a seed there. If you have successfully found a seed, you will be able to get the flag back for free from either Mrs. Winkin or Farmer Blinkin.






8. Rabbits roam the area and will attempt to eat seeds where flags are planted or where they have been dug up. Use the ogleroots that you find on them to make them disappear.

Mrs Winkin's World of Seeds










INTERFACE: 687






























Use a spade to dig in the farmer's field and try to work out where the seeds have been planted. Try not to dig up the seeds, as this will lose you points! Usually, when you dig a square, you will uncover a number, which shows how many seeds are in the holes next to it.






Plant your flags in holes where you think that seeds may be found. If you are correct, you will get lots of points, but if you are wrong, you will lose the flag. If you are close to other players, you might get some points if they find seeds, too!"

While you are in the area, you will be able to see your points total in the top-right corner of your screen. Your points are saved, so you can leave if you wish and return another time to pick up from where you left off.

If you place a flag over a seed, you will be able to get the flag back from Mrs. Winkin or Farmer Blinkin. If you placed a flag wrongly, you will have to pay 500gp for a new one.

How do you report a player for breaking the RuneScape Rules of Conduct?






By using the Report Abuse button at the bottom of my gaming screen






I should send an email to Customer Support.






I should find a Moderator and get them to report the player.










































































































































































































Correct.






You can use the Report Abuse button at the bottom of the game screen. Make sure you only report players who break the rules.













Incorrect.






We can only deal with reports that are sent in using the 'Report Abuse' button. Reporting players who break the rules allows us to ensure that RuneScape remains a positive and enjoyable environment for everyone. To find out more about reporting rulebreakers in RuneScape, please read the Rules of Conduct and then see our guide on reporting abuse. This can be accessed by clicking on the link: 'Customer Support' on our homepage and then 'Reporting Abuse'.

By waiting to find a Moderator, you run the risk of losing the ability to report the player.

Do not answer any questions and report the player using the Report Abuse button at the bottom of the game screen






Give them my details; they are a member of Jagex after all.

























































































































































Correct.






A real Jagex Moderator would never ask for a player's account details. You can always tell who an official moderator is as a gold crown will appear before anything they say in the chat window.

How long should you play RuneScape for at any one time?

I should take regular breaks in order to stay healthy.

It's very important to remain healthy by taking regular breaks and spending time doing other activities.

Bank of RuneScape - Help




















Item/note withdrawal: Clicking this button toggles how you withdraw items from your bank. `Item' mode places the actual item in your inventory; `Note' mode places a `noted' version of that object in your inventory. A note is worth the exact same value as the item it depicts, but is not the item itself and cannot be used as such. Notes are typically used for trading in bulk, as noted items can be stacked even if the actual item cannot be.






Deposit carried items and worn items. One button empties all of the items from your inventory, while the other moves all of the items you are wearing into your bank, if there is space. Items that cannot be placed in your bank will stay where they are.    


































Across the bottom of the bank there are some other features, which, from left to right, are: 






Swap/insert: Clicking this button toggles how items are rearranged in your bank. `Swap' mode means that the item you drag and the item it is dragged over will swap places in your bank. `Insert' mode allows you to place an item in a specific bank slot, shifting other items over to make room.






Search: Clicking this button will switch your bank to the main tab and open a search box. Type the name of the item you are looking for and it will narrow down your banked items as you type. (Note: don't worry, your other items aren't disappearing, they're just being removed from the current search and are still in your bank.) 




















The Bank of RuneScape is a great place to keep all of your belongings safe. The bank has branches all over RuneScape, so you're never very far away from your possessions.






The tab furthest to the left is the main bank tab (pictured left). The main tab will always display the entire contents of your bank account, but you can also create up to eight other tabs in which to categorise your banked items.






To create a new tab, simply drag any item in your bank on to the `plus' tab (pictured right). You can then drag as many other items as you want on to this new tab. Clicking on a tab other than the main one will show you only those items you have placed within it. The icon used to mark each new tab is taken from the first item within that tab.


































Using this tab system will allow you to easily group together related items as you wish. For instance, you could place all of your food in one tab, or all of your weapons in another. Alternatively, you could create a tab to contain all of those items you use to train a skill or play a certain activity. There is no limit to the number of times you can rearrange your bank, so feel free to experiment. 






Near the bottom-left corner of the bank you will see a set of four numbers, as shown to the left.













The first two numbers, separated by a diagonal line, represent your non-member bank space and how much of that bank space you have filled with non-member items. The second two numbers, separated by the other diagonal line, represent the bank space you have gained by being a member, and how much of that bank space you have filled with member items.

Voyage List

Open up the crew list to assign captains and crew to your current boat.






A ship can't sail without a captain. Click this one or drag it to the captain's spot on the roster above to assign it.






Our ship could sail, but the chance it'll succeed could be improved by adding crew; either drag them to a spot on the ship, or select the spot you wish to fill then click the crewman to assign them.






You can change your ship's stats by equipping new components. Click on the "Deck Items 2" hotspot to see what you can equip.






We could do with some more Seafaring, which we can get by swapping the currently equipped Small Crate of Food for some Weathered Rigging. Click on "Weathered Rigging" to see its stats.






Looks like you're ready - the voyage has an excellent chance of success. Click here to send it on its way.



















































































Crew Results
















































Now click the "Activate" button to switch the Food for Rigging, swapping some surplus Morale for Seafaring. Your overall chance of success (the lowest of the individual stat chances) will increase to 100%.






Assign crew as before by dragging them to a spot on the ship or by clicking a spot on the ship then on the crewman to assign.






Assigning a crewman has added his stats to your ship, and thereby increased your success chance. Assign the other crewman.




























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Failing a voyage brings penalties, the severity of which depends on your success chance; it's up to you what risks you want to take. For now, just assign your fourth crewman.












































































You're done here for now; click the Close button to exit the shipyard.

Choosing a lower complexity will make the dungeon more straight-forward to complete, but it will also lower the Dungeoneering XP reward you receive at the end.<br><br>When you first start Dungeoneering, only complexity 1 will be unlocked. You must complete at least one raid at that complexity before you can unlock the next.

Floor


































The deeper you go down into Daemonheim, the more powerful the creatures become. As the difficulty increases with depth, so does the Dungeoneering XP reward you receive at the end of a raid.<br><br>When you first start Dungeoneering, only floor 1 will be unlocked. You must complete a raid of a floor before you can unlock the next one, and you may only access a floor if you have the necessary Dungeoneering skill level.<br><br>All members of your party must have the floor unlocked for you to raid it. To see which floors are unlocked by all players, look at the columns that run vertically down the screen to the left - there's a column for each member of your group.

Safalaan Hallow,






I have desired to speak with you for so long. You may not know me, but I have been following you with great interest.






I shall get straight to the point, for there is little time. I knew your parents, Safalaan. I was very close to them and to you as a child, centuries ago when this land was free. 






I know you feel that you are different; that some part of your history is missing to you.

I can give you the answers you seek. I can tell you why you have lived so long, why you have these unexplained powers, why you have been having those visions.






Of course, though life was good, now I am just like the rest of us; struggling to survive in this place. I will be in sector four. Please meet me in the clearing in the centre. I have so much to tell you.

The numbers around the dance floor relate to the row or column they are lined up with, and tell you how many adjacent tiles within that row or column need to be turned on.<br><br>For instance, a row with 10 next to it would need all ten tiles in that row turned on; or a column with 4 next to it means four tiles need turning on in that column.






To begin sequencing a pattern, simply step out onto your dance floor and a series of numbers will become visible around its top and left edges.<br><br>These numbers tell you which dance floor tiles need to be turned on to create a pattern - in this case, a Halloween-themed image. To toggle tiles on or off, simply walk to one.









































Dance Floor Pattern Sequencing






Page%1






Page%2






Example skull pattern.






Some rows and columns might have more than one number next to them, as in the example on the other page.<br><br>The space between the numbers indicates there will be some off tiles between the sets of on tiles - note the difference between the three rows with the numbers '1 2 1' next to them, and how they differ.






Also in the example image are the columns '6 3', which would have to be six tiles on, one tile off, three tiles on - because 6+1+3 = 10. Finding rows or columns that have only one possible answer first is a good way to start.<br><br>The more tiles that are correctly turned on, the more information you have to solve other rows and columns.

Breakdown






The above fee will be taken from your money pouch should you proceed into the arena. You can get a certain amount of this fee back (potentially all of it) depending on your actions by visiting one of the banks in the arena.






Target abandonment: When you have a bounty target, if you log out for more than 5 minutes or return to one of the bank areas, part of your bounty fee will go to your opponent:






Death: You are expected to risk a certain value of equipment relative to your combat levels. If your bounty target kills you, you will lose from your fee a value equal to the appropriate amount of risk for your combat levels minus the value of items you are risking. So, the more you risk, the smaller this fee will be. This is:






Your total fee is the amount for 'target abandonment' plus the fee on death:

The aim of this game is to collect as many resource points as possible in five minutes. <br>You can gather resources from mining resources to the north,  woodcutting resources to the east or farming resources to the west. Different coloured resources are worth different numbers of resource points. They also require different skill levels.<br><br>Blue - Level 1<br>Gold - Level 20<br>Black - Level 40<br>Green - Level 60<br>Red - Level 80<br><br>Higher level resources are worth more points, but they take longer to respawn or regrow. Collect a variety of different resource types for a bonus to your score and experience reward.<br><br>Once you have harvested a resource, you must take it to the deposit point at the centre of the island. Only deposited resources count towards your final score.












































































Complete the game in the shortest number of turns possible by playing the right ability cards at the right time. 




















The coloured background relates to the racer that the ability affects. You will always be represented by a black border. To see the individual effects of an ability, hover your cursor over the picture. To exit the race early, use the cross at the top of the screen.






You must play one ability per turn. There are 90 abilities available - some of which are duplicates - and, if you run out of abilities, then your game will end. Be wary of the 'struggling' condition, which cannot be removed. If a runner gets three levels of the struggling condition, they will be removed from the race. 






























































It's a frantic race for cheese! Click any piece of cheese to start rolling it down the path, then cross the starting line to begin running at full speed. Run along and grab what is rightfully yours!<br><br> Click as fast as possible on either side of your character to move in that direction, dodging any of the obstacles on the course. Try not to trip up in your quest to catch the rolling cheese!
